  <tmdoc-title|Introduction to <name|GNUplot>>

  <name|Gnuplot> is a flexible and powerful command line graphing tool which
  is freely downloadable from <hlink|www.gnuplot.info|http://www.gnuplot.info>.
  It has been developed since 1986 and is available on all platforms
  supported by <TeXmacs> as well as many others. In <TeXmacs> it is possible
  to use it in <em|interactive sessions> as well as <em|executable folded
  environments> to seamlessly embedded dynamically created graphics in your
  documents. There also basic wrappers for easy creation of simple plots
  which don't require much customization.

  <\warning*>
    If you are using GNU <TeXmacs> on Windows, please install <name|Gnuplot>
    5.2.x instead of <name|Gnuplot 5.4.x>. We found that <name|Gnuplot> 5.4.3
    and 5.4.2 does not work with <TeXmacs>. And <name|Gnuplot> 5.2.8 and
    5.2.7 work fine.
