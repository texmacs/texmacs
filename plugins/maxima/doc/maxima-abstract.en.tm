  <tmdoc-title|The <name|Maxima> system>

  <hlink|<name|Maxima>|http://maxima.sourceforge.net/> is not only one of the
  oldest and best computer algebra systems around, it is also one of the only
  general purpose systems for which there is a free implementation. The
  current free <name|Maxima> implementation was started by
  <hlink|<name|William F. Schelter>|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Schelter>.
  It is dedicated to his memory. Here follow some features of <name|Maxima>:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Plotting via netmath over the network.

    <item>Computations over network

    <item>Well tested on a large array of problems.

    <item>Source level Debugger for maxima code

    <item>Documentation available as html, texinfo, info, dvi and postscript.
    The documentation can be read inside <TeXmacs>.

    <item>Easy to extend in fundamentally new ways, because you have complete
    access to source, and access to Common Lisp.

    <item>Portable to many systems.
  </itemize>
