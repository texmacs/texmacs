  <tmdoc-title|The <name|Eukleides> system>

  <hlink|Eukleides|http://www.eukleides.org/> is a Euclidean geometry drawing
  language. It has been designed in order to be close to the traditional
  language of elementary Euclidean geometry. In many cases, it makes possible
  to completely avoid the use of Cartesian coordinates.
