  <tmdoc-title|The <name|Cadabra> system>

  <hlink|Cadabra|https://cadabra.science/> is a computer algebra system for
  the manipulation of what could loosely be called <em|tensorial
  expressions>. It is aimed at, though not necessarily restricted to,
  theoretical high-energy physicists. Because of its target audience, the
  program's interface, storage system and underlying philosophy differ
  substantially from other computer algebra systems. Cadabra is developed by
  <hlink|<name|Kasper Peeters>|https://cadabra.science/people.html> and
  distributed under the GPL license.
