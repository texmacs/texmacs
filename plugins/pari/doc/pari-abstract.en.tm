  <tmdoc-title|The <name|Pari> system>

  <hlink|<name|Pari-gp>|http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr> is a software package
  for computer-aided number theory. It consists of a C library,
  <code*|libpari> (with optional assembler cores for some popular
  architectures), and of the programmable interactive <kbd|gp> calculator.
  While you can write your own <code*|libpari>-based programs, many people
  just start up a <kbd|gp> session, or have <kbd|gp> execute their scripts.
  Pari sessions can now be started inside <TeXmacs>.

  Developed at <hlink|Bordeaux|https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/> by a team led
  by <hlink|<name|Henri Cohen>|https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~hecohen/>,
  PARI-GP is now maintained by <hlink|<name|Karim
  Belabas>|https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~kbelabas/> with the help of many
  volunteer contributors.
