.SH NAME
GNU TeXmacs - a WYSIWYG mathematical text editor
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
texmacs [\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fISOURCE\fR]...
.PP
.SH INTRODUCTION
GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor, which was both inspired
by TeX and GNU Emacs. The editor allows you to write structured documents
via a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and user friendly interface.
New styles may be created by the user. The program implements high-quality
typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts, which help you to produce
professionally looking documents.
.PP
The high typesetting quality still goes through for automatically
generated formulas, which makes TeXmacs suitable as an interface
for computer algebra systems. TeXmacs also supports the Guile/Scheme
extension language, so that you may customize the interface and
write your own extensions to the editor.
.PP
TeXmacs currently runs on PC's and PPC's under Gnu/linux
(a >200MHz processor and >32Mb of memory are recommended)
and on sun computers. Converters exist for TeX/LaTeX and
they are under development for Html/Mathml/Xml.
In the future, TeXmacs is planned to evoluate towards
a complete scientific office suite, with spreadsheet capacities,
a technical drawing editor and a presentation mode.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP
\fB\-b [file]\fR, \fB\-\-initialize\-buffer [file]\fR
Uses [file] as a guile/scheme initialization file for TeXmacs buffers.
.TP
\fB\-c [in] [out]\fR, \fB\-\-convert [in] [out]\fR
Convert input file [in] into output file [out].
The file formats are determined automatically
from the suffixes and as a function of the contents of [in].
The argument list may contain several conversion instructions and
you will usually want to use this option in combination with --quit.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Display most important debugging information.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug-events\fR
Display all widget events.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug-io\fR
Display all communicated data between TeXmacs and extern systems.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug-all\fR
Turn all debugging flags on.
.TP
\fB\-\-delete-cache\fR
This option deletes all files in the TeXmacs cache. TeXmacs uses
several caches for speeding up font, file, directory and style file loading.
However, these optimizations may be incorrect when the user manually
changes files in the TeXmacs distribution or when new fonts are added.
This is rarely the case for normal users, but sometimes necessary
for TeXmacs developers.
.TP
\fB\-\-delete-doc-cache\fR
This option is similar to --delete-cache, but only deletes
the cache for accelerated help file loading.
.TP
\fB\-\-delete-file-cache\fR
This option is similar to --delete-cache, but only deletes
the cache for accelerated file loading.
.TP
\fB\-\-delete-font-cache\fR
This option is similar to --delete-cache, but only deletes
the cache for accelerated font loading.
.TP
\fB\-\-delete-style-cache\fR
This option is similar to --delete-cache, but only deletes
the cache for accelerated style file loading.
.TP
\fB\-fn [font]\fR, \fB\-\-font [font]\fR
Sets the default TeX fonts for menus and so to [font].
The [font] is of the form [name], [name][size] or [name][size]@[dpi].
For instance, ecss11@400 would give a sans serif font at 400 dpi.
By default, the [size] is 11 and the [dpi] 300.
.TP
\fB\-g [geom]\fR, \fB\-\-geometry [geom]\fR
Suggested geometry for TeXmacs windows.
Here [geom] may be a size [width x height] in pixels,
like in `texmacs -g 600x480'.
It may also take the form [width x height [+|-] xoff [+|-] yoff],
like in `texmacs -g 800x600-100+100'.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display a help message, which lists the command line options of TeXmacs.
.TP
\fB\-i [file]\fR, \fB\-\-initialize [file]\fR
Uses [file] as a guile/scheme initialization file for TeXmacs.
.TP
\fB\-Oc\fR, \fB\-\-no\-char\-clipping\fR
Faster but less perfect displaying of anti-aliased fonts.
.TP
\fB\+Oc\fR, \fB\-\-char\-clipping\fR
High quality displaying of anti-aliased fonts (default).
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-path\fR
Echo the TeXmacs path.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quit\fR
Shortcut for the option -x "(quit-TeXmacs)".
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reverse\fR
Reverse video mode. This mode inverts and weakens the intensity of all colors.
This option is only available as a global start-up option. You cannot change
it while running TeXmacs.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
Silent execution: less messages to standard output.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-setup\fR
Rerun the setup program before starting TeXmacs.
The setup program analyzes your TeX/LaTeX distribution and
the plugins which are installed on your system.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display the current TeXmacs version.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Display some informative messages.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-execute [cmd]\fR
Execute the scheme command [cmd] just after startup.
If you specify several -x options, then the corresponding
scheme commands are executed in the same order.
