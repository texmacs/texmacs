Description:  A structured wysiwyg scientific text editor
	     GNU TeXmacs is a free wysiwyw (what you see is what you want) editing
	     platform with special features for scientists. The software aims to provide
	     a unified and user friendly framework for editing structured documents with
	     different types of content (text, graphics, mathematics, interactive content,
	     etc.). The rendering engine uses high-quality typesetting algorithms so as to
	     produce professionally looking documents, which can either be printed out
	     or presented from a laptop.
	     The software includes a text editor with support for mathematical formulas,
	     a small technical picture editor and a tool for making presentations from
	     a laptop. Moreover, TeXmacs can be used as an interface for many external
	     systems for computer algebra, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.
	     New presentation styles can be written by the user and new features can be
	     added to the editor using the Scheme extension language. A native spreadsheet
	     and tools for collaborative authoring are planned for later.
	     TeXmacs runs on all major Unix platforms and Windows. Documents can be
	     saved in TeXmacs, Xml or Scheme format and printed as Postscript or
	     Pdf files. Converters exist for TeX/LaTeX and Html/Mathml.
