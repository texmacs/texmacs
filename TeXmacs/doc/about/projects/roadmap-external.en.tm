  <tmdoc-title|external developments>

  Some people which are not part of the core development team use <TeXmacs>
  for other projects. We do our best to support such external developments
  and make the necessary changes inside <TeXmacs> when necessary. Here
  follows a list of a few initiatives that we have been aware of:

  <\itemize>
    <item>Lionel Mamane has developed a plug-in for the
    <hlink|<name|Coq>|https://coq.inria.fr/> proof assistant, called
    <name|Tmegg>, but was never released publicly. Similarly, Henri Lesourd
    developed an interface to the \<Omega\>mega mathematical assistant
    system. The use of <TeXmacs> as a front-end for proof assistants and
    theorem provers raises interesting questions about asynchroneous plug-in
    evaluations, keeping track and appropriate rendering of the state of a
    prover, appropriate mathematical and proof markup, etc.

    <item>Saugata Basu, Richard Pollack and Marie-Fran�ois Roy have written
    an interactive book \P<hlink|Algorithms in Real Algebraic
    Geometry|https://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/marie-francoise.roy/bpr-ed2-posted3.html>\Q
    using <TeXmacs>. Any people interested in developing addional interactive
    features inside <TeXmacs> are invited to contact us.

    <item><hlink|Felix Breuer|http://www.felixbreuer.net/index.html> and
    formerly <name|David Mentr�> have considered developing a <hlink|literate
    programming plug-in|http://www.felixbreuer.net/LP4TeXmacs-0.1.tar.gz> for
    <TeXmacs>. Another such initiative is
    <hlink|<name|Fangle>|http://www.nongnu.org/fangle/>, which has recently
    been started by <name|Sam Liddicott>. Any concrete implementation of
    their proposals would happily find its way into the main distribution.
  </itemize>

  If you want to start a project based on <TeXmacs>, then please let us know.
