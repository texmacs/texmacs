    <item*|Fonts>

    The <TeXmacs> program uses professional <TeX> fonts. When you launch the
    program for the first time, many of these fonts may have to be generated,
    which may significantly slow down the editor. Keep cool: each font needs
    only to be generated once. At\

    you may also find some instructions about how to download some
    pregenerated fonts.
