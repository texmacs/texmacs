  <tmdoc-title|Use <TeXmacs>>

  One of the best ways to contribute to GNU <TeXmacs> is by using it a lot,
  talk about it to friends and colleagues, and to report me about bugs or
  other unnatural behaviour. Please mention the fact that you wrote articles
  using <TeXmacs> when submitting them. You can do this by putting the
  <markup|made-by-TeXmacs> tag somewhere inside your title using
  <icon|tm_add.xpm> on the Title toolbar.

  Besides these general (but very important) ways to contribute, your help on
  the more specific subjects below would be appreciated. Don't hesitate to
  <hlink|contact us|../../authors/contact.en.tm> if you want to contribute to
  these or any other issues. In the <menu|Help> menu you can find
  documentation about the <hlink|source code|../../../devel/source/source.en.tm>
  of <TeXmacs>, its <hlink|document format|../../../devel/format/basics/basics.en.tm>,
  how to write <hlink|interfaces|../../../devel/plugin/plugin.en.tm> with
  other formats, and so on.
