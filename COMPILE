Compiling GNU TeXmacs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Check dependencies.

   Before you compile GNU TeXmacs on your system, you have to make
   sure that the other programs on which GNU TeXmacs depends,
   such as Guile Scheme, FreeType 2, libiconv, etc.
   Configuration will fail if one if these dependencies are missing.

   There are also a certain number of optional dependencies,
   which may depend on your operating system, such as aspell,
   ImageMagick, or netpbm.

2. Compile, install and run.

   GNU TeXmacs supports the standard GNU compilation and
   installation procedure. Assuming that you logged yourself
   in as root, cd into the installation directory and type

	./configure
	make
	make install

   The first command examines your particular system configuration.
   The second command launches the compilation.
   The last command installs GNU TeXmacs in /usr/local.

   If you get an error when runnig 'make', be sure that you are using
   GNU make. You can check the version of make installed on your
   system by running 'make -v'. You may freely download GNU make at
 
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make

   If everything works fine, then you should be able to run the program by

	texmacs &

   If this does not work, you should make sure that /usr/local/bin
   is in your PATH. Depending on your shell, you can ensure this by typing

	export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
   or
	setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:$PATH

3. Feedback

   Be cool and let us know if you like or dislike the program; see

	http://www.texmacs.org

   It is very useful for us to have a rough idea about the number of
   permanent users and for what applications you are interested in TeXmacs.
   Furthermore, we are glad to receive your suggestions and problems,
   no matter how silly they may seem to you. If you really like the program,
   then please consider donating money or services to us; see

	http://www.texmacs.org/Web/Donations.html

   Of course, you may also contribute yourself.

Appendix A: Configuration options

   If you cannot log yourself in as root, or if you want to install
   TeXmacs elsewhere than in /usr/local, then you should use

	./configure --prefix=[target directory]

   instead of ./configure. In this case, TeXmacs will be installed in
   [target directory] and you will have to set your PATH accordingly,
   as to contain [target directory]/bin. You can fine tune the
   installation paths with the options

   * --bindir=[binary directory]:
     sets the directory where the TeXmacs binaries should be installed
     ([target directory]/bin, by default).

   * --datadir=[data directory]:
     sets the directory where other TeXmacs data should be installed
     ([target directory]/share, by default).

   The configuration script try to pick the best optimization options
   for your architecture and compiler. Some versions of g++ have
   trouble optimizing TeXmacs and will produce a buggy executable
   unless inlining is turned off.

   * --disable-optimize
     --enable-optimize
     --enable-optimize=no-inline
     --enable-optimize=[compiler options]:
     overrides the (system dependent) default optimization settings.

   If you are hacking on TeXmacs, you may want to install an
   executable with debugging information.

   * --enable-debug
     --enable-debug=[compiler options]:
     build and install a debugger-enabled executable
     (compiler options defaults to -ggdb).

   This option specifies a compiler option, disable stripping of the
   installed executable and turn optimizations off. The option
   --enable-optimization can force optimizations, without a parameter
   it will use the architecture dependent default *with inlining*.

Appendix B: Static compilation

   By default, we build TeXmacs using dynamically linked libraries.
   If you rather want to build the static version, use

	make STATIC_TEXMACS

Appendix C: Possible problems

   * Everything compiles fine, but you frequently get
     a segmentation fault when running the editor.
     Solution: This problem may have several causes:
     o You don't use a standard version of the GNU C++ compiler.
       We use gcc-2.95.3 on a GNU/Linux system on a PC;
       the versions 2.95.2 and 1.1.* should also work,
       but the optimizer may be bugged in other versions.
       Using the --disable-optimize option to ./configure
       may produce a more stable, but slower executable.
     o You are compiling TeXmacs on a not yet supported system.
       Please take a look at configure.in
       in order to see whether your system is supported.
       If not, please check that the macros WORD_LENGTH,
       WORD_LENGTH_INC and WORD_MASK are OK for your system.

    * You use Cygwin and you do not manage to get Guile working.
      Solution: There may be a problem with the file name
      ice-9/and-let*.scm (stars are not allowed in file names),
      which should be renamed as ice-9/and-let-star.scm. You should
      make the corresponding modifications in ice-9/Makefile.in.
      Since you might be unable to extract ice-9/and-let*.scm
      from the archive, you can find a copy of it (for guile-1.4)
      at http://www.texmacs.org/Data/and-let-star.scm

    * You have problems with compiling or linking with X Window.
      Solution: modify some of the compilation options in configure.in.

    * You have the impression that some of the modifications that you
      made in the source are not taken into account when you run make.
      Solution: type 'make deps' in order to generate the dependence
      files and/or 'rm src/Objects/*' in order to be sure that the
      object files are rebuilt.

    * If you encounter other problems, or if our fixes don't work, then please
      contact us at contact@texmacs.org.
